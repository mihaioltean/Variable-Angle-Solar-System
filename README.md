# A Variable-angle solar system

## Motivation

According to [https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/ calculator](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/), the power generated by a solar system varies greatly depending on angle of the solar panels. 
For instance, for my region (Cugir, Romania) a 6kWh system can generate, in December:
- 1.1 kWh, if the angle is set to 18 degrees
and
- 1.7 kWh if the angle is set to 62 degrees.

That is huge for winter times!

So, I decided to build a variable-angle solar system...

## Source code

If you want to visualize the system, you can download the source code from the [src](src) folder.
You need [OpenSCAD](www.openscad.org) to visualize it.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

- Screws with 30mm rings. - about 4 of them for each panel. Screws will lock the system in the roof. They have to be long enough to enter minimum 5cm in the roof.
- 20x20x2mm tubes. They are placed at the base and pass through the rings of the screws.
- 40x20x2mm tubes - for supporting the solar panels. Length depends on the size of the solar panels.
- 40x20x2 tubes - for vertical support. 6 holes are needed for various angles.
- 50mm corners - for fixing the panels to tubes. I've made them from aluminium.
